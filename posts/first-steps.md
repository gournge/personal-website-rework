# First Steps with Fourier Series

Any reasonable \(2\pi\)-periodic function can be expanded as

\[
f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)\right).
\]

The coefficients \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) come from projecting onto sines and cosines. We'll unpack the geometry and convergence ideas in a follow‑up.
